# Tutorial: Detecting and redacting PII data with S3 Object Lambda and Amazon Comprehend<a name="tutorial-s3-object-lambda-redact-pii"></a>

When you're using Amazon S3 for shared datasets for multiple applications and users to access, it's important to restrict privileged information, such as personally identifiable information \(PII\), to only authorized entities\. For example, when a marketing application uses some data containing PII, it might need to first mask PII data to meet data privacy requirements\. Also, when an analytics application uses a production order inventory dataset, it might need to first redact customer credit card information to prevent unintended data leakage\.

With [S3 Object Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/object-lambda) and a prebuilt AWS Lambda function powered by Amazon Comprehend, you can protect PII data retrieved from S3 before returning it to an application\. Specifically, you can use the prebuilt [Lambda function](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) as a redacting function and attach it to an S3 Object Lambda access point\. When an application \(for example, an analytics application\) sends [standard S3 GET requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html), these requests made through the S3 Object Lambda access point invoke the prebuilt redacting Lambda function to detect and redact PII data retrieved from an S3 bucket through a supporting S3 access point\. Then, the S3 Object Lambda access point returns the redacted result back to the application\.

![\[This is an S3 Object Lambda workflow diagram.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/images/ol-comprehend-image-global.png)

In the process, the prebuilt Lambda function uses [Amazon Comprehend](http://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/), a natural language processing \(NLP\) service, to capture variations in how PII is represented, regardless of how PII exists in text \(such as numerically or as a combination of words and numbers\)\. Amazon Comprehend can even use context in the text to understand if a 4\-digit number is a PIN, the last four numbers of a Social Security number \(SSN\), or a year\. Amazon Comprehend processes any text file in UTF\-8 format and can protect PII at scale without affecting accuracy\. For more information, see [What is Amazon Comprehend?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/what-is.html) in the *Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide*\.

**Objective**  
In this tutorial, you learn how to use S3 Object Lambda with the prebuilt Lambda function `ComprehendPiiRedactionS3ObjectLambda`\. This function uses Amazon Comprehend to detect PII entities\. It then redacts these entities by replacing them with asterisks\. By redacting PII, you conceal sensitive data, which can help with security and compliance\.

You also learn how to use and configure a prebuilt AWS Lambda function in the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](http://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/) to work together with S3 Object Lambda for easy deployment\.

## Prerequisites: Create an IAM user with permissions<a name="ol-pii-prerequisites"></a>

Before you start this tutorial, you must have an AWS account that you can sign in to as an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user with correct permissions\.

You can create an IAM user for the tutorial, or you can add permissions to an existing IAM user\. To complete this tutorial, your IAM user must attach the following IAM policies to access relevant AWS resources and perform specific actions\. 

**Note**  
For simplicity, this tutorial uses full\-access policies\. For production use, we recommend that you instead grant only the minimum permissions necessary for your use case, in accordance with [security best practices](security-best-practices.md#security-best-practices-prevent)\.

Your IAM user requires the following AWS managed policies:
+ [AmazonS3FullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess$jsonEditor) – Grants permissions to all Amazon S3 actions, including permissions to create and use an Object Lambda access point\. 
+ [AWSLambda\_FullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSLambda_FullAccess$jsonEditor) – Grants permissions to all Lambda actions\. 
+ [AWSCloudFormationFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCloudFormationFullAccess$serviceLevelSummary) – Grants permissions to all AWS CloudFormation actions\.
+ [IAMFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMFullAccess$jsonEditor) – Grants permissions to all IAM actions\. 
+ [IAMAccessAnalyzerReadOnlyAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMAccessAnalyzerReadOnlyAccess$jsonEditor) – Grants permissions to read all access information provided by IAM Access Analyzer\. 

You can directly attach these existing policies when creating an IAM user\. For more information about how to create an IAM user, see [Creating IAM users \(console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

In addition, your IAM user requires a customer managed policy\. To grant the IAM user permissions to all AWS Serverless Application Repository resources and actions, you must create an IAM policy and attach the policy to the IAM user\.

**To create and attach an IAM policy to your IAM user**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Policies**\.

1. Choose **Create policy**\. 

1. On the **Visual editor** tab, for **Service**, choose **Choose a service**\. Then, choose **Serverless Application Repository**\. 

1. For **Actions**, under **Manual actions**, select **All Serverless Application Repository actions \(serverlessrepo:\*\)** for this tutorial\.

   As a security best practice, you should allow permissions to only those actions and resources that a user needs, based on your use case\. For more information, see [ Security best practices in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

1. For **Resources**, choose **All resources** for this tutorial\.

   As a best practice, you should define permissions for only specific resources in specific accounts\. Alternatively, you can grant least privilege using condition keys\. For more information, see [ Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

1. Choose **Next: Tags**\.

1. Choose **Next: Review**\.

1. On the **Review policy** page, enter a **Name** \(for example, **tutorial\-serverless\-application\-repository**\) and a **Description** \(optional\) for the policy that you are creating\. Review the policy summary to make sure that you have granted the intended permissions, and then choose **Create policy** to save your new policy\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Users**\. Then, choose the IAM user for this tutorial\. 

1. On the **Summary** page of the chosen user, choose the **Permissions** tab, and then choose **Add permissions**\.

1. Under **Grant permissions**, choose **Attach existing policies directly**\.

1. Select the check box next to the policy that you just created \(for example, **tutorial\-serverless\-application\-repository**\) and then choose **Next: Review**\. 

1. Under **Permissions summary**, review the summary to make sure that you attached the intended policy\. Then, choose **Add permissions**\.

## Step 1: Create an S3 bucket<a name="ol-pii-step1"></a>

Create a bucket to store the original data that you plan to transform\. 

**To create a bucket**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Buckets**\.

1. Choose **Create bucket**\. 

   The **Create bucket** page opens\.

1. For **Bucket name**, enter a name \(for example, **tutorial\-bucket**\) for your bucket\. 

   For more information about naming buckets in Amazon S3, see [Bucket naming rules](bucketnamingrules.md)\.

1. For **Region**, choose the AWS Region where you want the bucket to reside\. 

   For more information about the bucket Region, see [Buckets overview](UsingBucket.md)\.

1. For **Block Public Access settings for this bucket**, keep the default settings \(**Block *all *public access** is enabled\)\. 

   We recommend that you keep all Block Public Access settings enabled unless you need to turn off one or more of them for your use case\. For more information about blocking public access, see [Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage](access-control-block-public-access.md)\.

1. For the remaining settings, keep the defaults\. 

   \(Optional\) If you want to configure additional bucket settings for your specific use case, see [Creating a bucket](create-bucket-overview.md)\.

1. Choose **Create bucket**\.

## Step 2: Upload a file to the S3 bucket<a name="ol-pii-step2"></a>

Upload a text file containing known PII data of various types, such as names, banking information, phone numbers, and SSNs, to the S3 bucket as the original data that you will redact PII from later in this tutorial\. 

For example, you can upload following the `tutorial.txt` file\. This is an example input file from Amazon Comprehend\.

```

```

**To upload a file to a bucket**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Buckets**\.

1. In the **Buckets** list, choose the name of the bucket that you created in [Step 1](#ol-pii-step1) \(for example, **tutorial\-bucket**\) to upload your file to\.

1. On the **Objects** tab for your bucket, choose **Upload**\.

1. On the **Upload** page, under **Files and folders**, choose **Add files**\.

1. Choose a file to upload, and then choose **Open**\. For example, you can upload the `tutorial.txt` file example mentioned earlier\.

1. Choose **Upload**\.

## Step 3: Create an S3 access point<a name="ol-pii-step3"></a>

To use an S3 Object Lambda access point to access and transform the original data, you must create an S3 access point and associate it with the S3 bucket that you created in [Step 1](#ol-pii-step1)\. The access point must be in the same AWS Region as the objects you want to transform\.

Later in this tutorial, you'll use this access point as a supporting access point for your Object Lambda access point\. 

**To create an access point**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Access Points**\.

1. On the **Access Points** page, choose **Create access point**\.

1. In the **Access point name** field, enter the name \(for example, **tutorial\-pii\-access\-point**\) for the access point\.

   For more information about naming access points, see [Rules for naming Amazon S3 access points](creating-access-points.md#access-points-names)\.

1. In the **Bucket name** field, enter the name of the bucket that you created in [Step 1](#ol-pii-step1) \(for example, **tutorial\-bucket**\)\. S3 attaches the access point to this bucket\. 

   \(Optional\) You can choose **Browse S3** to browse and search the buckets in your account\. If you choose **Browse S3**, choose the desired bucket, and then choose **Choose path** to populate the **Bucket name** field with that bucket's name\.

1. For **Network origin**, choose **Internet**\. 

   For more information about network origins for access points, see [Creating access points restricted to a virtual private cloud](access-points-vpc.md)\.

1. By default, all block public access settings are turned on for your access point\. We recommend that you keep **Block *all* public access** enabled\. For more information, see [Managing public access to access points](access-points-bpa-settings.md)\.

1. For all other access point settings, keep the default settings\.

   \(Optional\) You can modify the access point settings to support your use case\. For this tutorial, we recommend keeping the default settings\. 

   \(Optional\) If you need to manage access to your access point, you can specify an access point policy\. For more information, see [Access point policy examples](access-points-policies.md#access-points-policy-examples)\. 

1. Choose **Create access point**\.

## Step 4: Configure and deploy a prebuilt Lambda function<a name="ol-pii-step4"></a>

To redact PII data, configure and deploy the prebuilt AWS Lambda function `ComprehendPiiRedactionS3ObjectLambda` for use with your S3 Object Lambda access point\.

**To configure and deploy the Lambda function**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and view the [https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:839782855223:applications/ComprehendPiiRedactionS3ObjectLambda](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:839782855223:applications/ComprehendPiiRedactionS3ObjectLambda) function in the AWS Serverless Application Repository\.

1. For **Application settings**, under **Application name**, keep the default value \(`ComprehendPiiRedactionS3ObjectLambda`\) for this tutorial\.

   \(Optional\) You can enter the name that you want to give to this application\. You might want to do this if you plan to configure multiple Lambda functions for different access needs for the same shared dataset\.

1. For **MaskCharacter**, keep the default value \(`*`\)\. The mask character replaces each character in the redacted PII entity\. 

1. For **MaskMode**, keep the default value \(**MASK**\)\. The **MaskMode** value specifies whether the PII entity is redacted with the `MASK` character or the `PII_ENTITY_TYPE` value\.

1. To redact the specified types of data, for **PiiEntityTypes**, keep the default value **ALL**\. The **PiiEntityTypes** value specifies the PII entity types to be considered for redaction\. 

   For more information about the list of supported PII entity types, see [Detect Personally Identifiable Information \(PII\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-pii.html) in the *Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide*\.

1. Keep the remaining settings set to the defaults\.

   \(Optional\) If you want to configure additional settings for your specific use case, see the **Readme file** section on the left side of the page\.

1. Select the check box next to **I acknowledge that this app creates custom IAM roles**\.

1. Choose **Deploy**\.

1. On the new application's page, under **Resources**, choose the **Logical ID** of the Lambda function that you deployed to review the function on the Lambda function page\.

## Step 5: Create an S3 Object Lambda access point<a name="ol-pii-step5"></a>

An S3 Object Lambda access point provides the flexibility to invoke a Lambda function directly from an S3 GET request so that the function can redact PII data retrieved from an S3 access point\. When creating and configuring an S3 Object Lambda access point, you must specify the redacting Lambda function to invoke and provide the event context in JSON format as custom parameters for Lambda to use\. 

The event context provides information about the request being made in the event passed from S3 Object Lambda to Lambda\. For more information about all the fields in the event context, see [Event context format and usage](olap-event-context.md)\.

**To create an S3 Object Lambda access point**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Object Lambda Access Points**\.

1. On the **Object Lambda Access Points** page, choose **Create Object Lambda Access Point**\.

1. For **Object Lambda Access Point name**, enter the name that you want to use for the Object Lambda access point \(for example, **tutorial\-pii\-object\-lambda\-accesspoint**\)\. 

1. For **Supporting Access Point**, enter or browse to the standard access point that you created in [Step 3](#ol-pii-step3) \(for example, **tutorial\-pii\-access\-point**\), and then choose **Choose supporting Access Point**\. 

1. For **Invoke Lambda function**, you can choose either of the following two options for this tutorial\. 
   + Choose **Choose from functions in your account** and choose the Lambda function that you deployed in [Step 4](#ol-pii-step4) \(for example, **serverlessrepo\-ComprehendPiiRedactionS3ObjectLambda**\) from the **Lambda function** dropdown list\.
   + Choose **Enter ARN**, and then enter the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the Lambda function that you created in [Step 4](#ol-pii-step4)\.

1. For **Lambda function version**, choose **$LATEST** \(the latest version of the Lambda function that you deployed in [Step 4](#ol-pii-step4)\)\.

1. \(Optional\) If you need your Lambda function to recognize and process GET requests with range and part number headers, select **Lambda function supports requests using range** and **Lambda function supports requests using part numbers**\. Otherwise, clear these two check boxes\.

   For more information about how to use range or part numbers with S3 Object Lambda, see [Working with Range and partNumber headers](range-get-olap.md)\.

1. \(Optional\) Under **Payload \- *optional***, add JSON text to provide your Lambda function with additional information\.

   A payload is optional JSON text that you can provide to your Lambda function as input for all invocations coming from a specific S3 Object Lambda access point\. To customize the behaviors for multiple Object Lambda access points that invoke the same Lambda function, you can configure payloads with different parameters, thereby extending the flexibility of your Lambda function\.

   For more information about payload, see [Event context format and usage](olap-event-context.md)\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Request metrics \- *optional***, choose **Disable** or **Enable** to add Amazon S3 monitoring to your Object Lambda access point\. Request metrics are billed at the standard Amazon CloudWatch rate\. For more information, see [CloudWatch pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/)\.

1. Under **Object Lambda Access Point policy \- *optional***, keep the default setting\. 

   \(Optional\) You can set a resource policy\. This resource policy grants the `GetObject` API permission to use the specified Object Lambda access point\.

1. Keep the remaining settings set to the defaults, and choose **Create Object Lambda Access Point**\.

## Step 6: Use the S3 Object Lambda access point to retrieve the redacted file<a name="ol-pii-step6"></a>

Now, S3 Object Lambda is ready to redact PII data from your original file\. 

**To use the S3 Object Lambda access point to retrieve the redacted file**

When you request to retrieve a file through your S3 Object Lambda access point, you make a `GetObject` API call to S3 Object Lambda\. S3 Object Lambda invokes the Lambda function to redact your PII data and returns the transformed data as the response to the standard S3 `GetObject` API call\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Object Lambda Access Points**\.

1. On the **Object Lambda Access Points** page, choose the S3 Object Lambda access point that you created in [Step 5](#ol-pii-step5) \(for example, **tutorial\-pii\-object\-lambda\-accesspoint**\)\.

1. On the **Objects** tab of your S3 Object Lambda access point, select the file that has the same name \(for example, `tutorial.txt`\) as the one that you uploaded to the S3 bucket in [Step 2](#ol-pii-step2)\. 

   This file should contain all the transformed data\.

1. To view the transformed data, choose **Open** or **Download**\.

    You should be able to see the redacted file, as shown in the following example\. 

   ```
   Hello *********. Your AnyCompany Financial Services, 
   LLC credit card account ******************* has a minimum payment 
   of $24.53 that is due by *********. Based on your autopay settings, 
   we will withdraw your payment on the due date from your 
   bank account ********** with the routing number *********. 
   
   Your latest statement was mailed to **********************************. 
   After your payment is received, you will receive a confirmation 
   text message at ************. 
   If you have questions about your bill, AnyCompany Customer Service 
   is available by phone at ************ or 
   email at **********************.
   ```

## Step 7: Clean up<a name="ol-pii-step7"></a>

## Next steps<a name="ol-pii-next-steps"></a>

After completing this tutorial, you can further explore the following related use cases:
+ You can create multiple S3 Object Lambda access points and enable them with prebuilt Lambda functions that are configured differently to redact specific types of PII depending on the data accessors' business needs\. 

  Each type of user assumes an IAM role and only has access to one S3 Object Lambda access point \(managed through IAM policies\)\. Then, you attach each `ComprehendPiiRedactionS3ObjectLambda` Lambda function configured for a different redaction use case to a different S3 Object Lambda access point\. For each S3 Object Lambda access point, you can have a supporting S3 access point to read data from an S3 bucket that stores the shared dataset\. 

  For more information about how to create an S3 bucket policy that allows users to read from the bucket only through S3 access points, see [Configuring IAM policies for using access points](access-points-policies.md)\.

  For more information about how to grant a user permission to access the Lambda function, the S3 access point, and the S3 Object Lambda access point, see [Configuring IAM policies for Object Lambda access points](olap-policies.md)\.
+ You can build your own Lambda function and use S3 Object Lambda with your customized Lambda function to meet your specific data needs\.

  For example, to explore various data values, you can use S3 Object Lambda and your own Lambda function that uses additional [Amazon Comprehend features](http://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/features/), such as entity recognition, key phrase recognition, sentiment analysis, and document classification, to process data\. You can also use S3 Object Lambda together with [Amazon Comprehend Medical](http://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/), a HIPAA\-eligible NLP service, to analyze and extract data in a context\-aware manner\.

  For more information about how to transform data with S3 Object Lambda and your own Lambda function, see [Tutorial: Transforming data for your application with S3 Object Lambda](tutorial-s3-object-lambda-uppercase.md)\.
