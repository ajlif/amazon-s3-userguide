# Amazon S3 replication failure reasons<a name="replication-failure-codes"></a>

The following table lists Amazon S3 Replication failure reasons\. These can be viewed as the **failureReason** with Amazon S3 event notifications through Amazon Simple Queue Service \(Amazon SQS\), Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\), or AWS Lambda\.
