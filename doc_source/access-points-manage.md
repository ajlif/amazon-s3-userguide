## Listing access points for your account<a name="access-points-detail-page-nav"></a>

**To list all access points created in your AWS account**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose **access points**\.

1. On the **access points** page, under **access points**, select the AWS Region that contains the access points you want to list\.

1. \(Optional\) Search for access points by name by entering a name into the text field next to the Region dropdown menu\.

1. Choose the name of the access point you want to manage or use\.

## Listing access points for a bucket<a name="listing-access-points-bucket"></a>

**To list all access points in you AWS account for a single bucket**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose **Buckets**\.

1. On the **Buckets** page, select the name of the bucket whose access points you want to list\.

1. On the bucket detail page, choose the **access points** tab\.

1. Choose the name of the access point you want to manage or use\.

## Viewing configuration details for an access point<a name="access-points-manage-use-detail"></a>

1. Navigate to the access point detail page for the access point whose details you want to view, as described in [Listing access points for your account](#access-points-detail-page-nav)\.

1. Under **access point overview**, view configuration details and properties for the selected access point\.

## Using an access point<a name="use-single-access-point"></a>

1. Navigate to the access point detail page for the access point you want to use, as described in [Listing access points for your account](#access-points-detail-page-nav)\.

1. Under the **Objects** tab, choose the name of an object or objects that you want to access through the access point\. On the object operation pages, the console displays a label above the name of your bucket that shows the access point that you're currently using\. While you're using the access point, you can only perform the object operations that are allowed by the access point permissions\.
**Note**  
The console view always shows all objects in the bucket\. Using an access point as described in this procedure restricts the operations you can perform on those objects, but not whether you can see that they exist in the bucket\.
The S3 Management Console doesn't support using virtual private cloud \(VPC\) access points to access bucket resources\. To access bucket resources from a VPC access point, use the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or Amazon S3 REST APIs\.
