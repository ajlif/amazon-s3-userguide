# Multi\-Region Access Point restrictions and limitations<a name="MultiRegionAccessPointRestrictions"></a>

Multi\-Region Access Points in Amazon S3 have the following restrictions and limitations\. 
+  Multi\-Region Access Point names: 
  +  Must be unique within a single AWS account\. 
  +  Must begin with a number or lowercase letter\. 
  +  Must be between 3 and 50 characters long\. 
  +  Can't begin or end with a dash\. 
  +  Can't contain underscores, uppercase letters, or periods\. 
  +  Can't be edited after they are created\. 
+  Multi\-Region Access Point aliases are generated by Amazon S3 and can’t be edited or reused\. 
+  You cannot access data through a Multi\-Region Access Point using gateway endpoints or interface endpoints\. In order to use AWS PrivateLink, you must create Multi\-Region Access Point endpoints\. For more information, see [Configuring a Multi\-Region Access Point for use with AWS PrivateLink](MultiRegionAccessPointsPrivateLink.md)\. 
+  You cannot use a Multi\-Region Access Point as the distribution origin for Amazon CloudFront\. However, you can configure Multi\-Region Access Points as a custom distribution origin with Amazon CloudFront\. For more details, see [ Building an active\-active, latency\-based application across multiple Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/building-an-active-active-latency-based-application-across-multiple-regions/) on the *AWS Storage Blog*\. 
+ Multi\-Region Access Point minimum requirements: 
  + Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) v1\.2
  + Signature Version 4 \(SigV4A\)

    Multi\-Region Access Points support Signature Version 4A\. This version of SigV4 allows requests to be signed for multiple AWS Regions\. This is useful in API operations that might result in data access from one of several Regions\. When using the AWS SDK, you supply your credentials and the requests to Multi\-Region Access Points will use Signature Version 4A without additional configuration\. For more information about SigV4A, see [Signing AWS API requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.
