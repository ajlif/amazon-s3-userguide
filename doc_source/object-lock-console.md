# Configuring S3 Object Lock using the console<a name="object-lock-console"></a>

With S3 Object Lock, you can store objects in Amazon S3 using a *write\-once\-read\-many* \(WORM\) model\. You can use S3 Object Lock to prevent an object from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely\. For more information about S3 Object Lock capabilities, see [How S3 Object Lock works](object-lock-overview.md)\.

To use S3 Object Lock, follow these basic steps:

1. Create a new bucket with Object Lock enabled\.

1. \(Optional\) Configure a default retention period for objects placed in the bucket\.

1. Place the objects that you want to lock in the bucket\.

1. Apply a retention period, a legal hold, or both, to the objects that you want to protect\.

Before you lock any objects, you have to enable a bucket to use S3 Object Lock\. You enable Object Lock when you create a bucket\. After you enable Object Lock on a bucket, you can lock objects in that bucket\. When you create a bucket with Object Lock enabled, you can't disable Object Lock or suspend versioning for that bucket\. 

For information about creating a bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled, see [Creating a bucket](create-bucket-overview.md)\.
