# Listing Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets<a name="S3OutpostsListBuckets"></a>

With Amazon S3 on Outposts, you can create S3 buckets on your AWS Outposts and easily store and retrieve objects on premises for applications that require local data access, local data processing, and data residency\. S3 on Outposts provides a new storage class, S3 Outposts \(`OUTPOSTS`\), which uses the Amazon S3 APIs, and is designed to store data durably and redundantly across multiple devices and servers on your AWS Outposts\. You communicate with your Outpost bucket by using an access point and endpoint connection over a virtual private cloud \(VPC\)\. You can use the same APIs and features on Outpost buckets as you do on Amazon S3 buckets, including access policies, encryption, and tagging\. You can use S3 on Outposts through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), AWS SDKs, or REST API\. For more information, see [What is Amazon S3 on Outposts?](S3onOutposts.md)

For more information about working with buckets in S3 on Outposts, see [Working with S3 on Outposts buckets](S3OutpostsWorkingBuckets.md)\.

The following examples show you how to return a list of your S3 on Outposts buckets by using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDK for Java\.

## Using the S3 console<a name="s3-outposts-bucket-list"></a>

1. Open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Outposts buckets**\.

1. Under **Outposts buckets**, review your list of S3 on Outposts buckets\.

## Using the AWS CLI<a name="S3OutpostsListRegionalBucketCLI"></a>

The following AWS CLI example gets a list of buckets in an Outpost\. To use this command, replace each `user input placeholder` with your own information\. For more information about this command, see [list\-regional\-buckets](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3control/list-regional-buckets.html) in the *AWS CLI Reference*\.

```
aws s3control list-regional-buckets --account-id 123456789012 --outpost-id op-01ac5d28a6a232904
```

## Using the AWS SDK for Java<a name="S3OutpostsListRegionalBucketJava"></a>

The following SDK for Java example gets a list of buckets in an Outpost\. For more information, see [ListRegionalBuckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_ListRegionalBuckets.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference*\.

```
import com.amazonaws.services.s3control.model.*;

public void listRegionalBuckets() {

    ListRegionalBucketsRequest reqListBuckets = new ListRegionalBucketsRequest()
            .withAccountId(AccountId)
            .withOutpostId(OutpostId);

    ListRegionalBucketsResult respListBuckets = s3ControlClient.listRegionalBuckets(reqListBuckets);
    System.out.printf("ListRegionalBuckets Response: %s%n", respListBuckets.toString());

}
