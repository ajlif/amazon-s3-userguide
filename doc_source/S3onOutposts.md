# What is Amazon S3 on Outposts?<a name="S3onOutposts"></a>

AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that offers the same AWS infrastructure, AWS services, APIs, and tools to virtually any data center, co\-location space, or on\-premises facility for a truly consistent hybrid experience\. AWS Outposts is ideal for workloads that require low\-latency access to on\-premises systems, local data processing, data residency, and migration of applications with local system interdependencies\. For more information, see [What is AWS Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/what-is-outposts.htm) in the *AWS Outposts User Guide*\.

With Amazon S3 on Outposts, you can create S3 buckets on your AWS Outposts and easily store and retrieve objects on premises\. S3 on Outposts provides a new storage class, `OUTPOSTS`, which uses the Amazon S3 APIs and is designed to store data durably and redundantly across multiple devices and servers on your AWS Outposts\. You communicate with your Outposts bucket by using an access point and endpoint connection over a virtual private cloud \(VPC\)\. You can use the same APIs and features on Outposts buckets as you do on Amazon S3, including access policies, encryption, and tagging\. You can use S3 on Outposts through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), AWS SDKs, or REST API\.

## How S3 on Outposts works<a name="S3OutpostsConcepts"></a>

S3 on Outposts is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets on your Outpost\. An *object* is a data file and any metadata that describes the file\. A *bucket* is a container for objects\. 

To store your data in S3 on Outposts, you first create a bucket\. When you create the bucket, you specify a bucket name and the Outpost that will hold the bucket\. To access your S3 on Outposts bucket and perform object operations, you next create and configure an access point\. You must also create an endpoint to route requests to your access point\. 

Access points simplify data access for any AWS service or customer application that stores data in S3\. Access points are named network endpoints that are attached to buckets and can be used to perform object operations, such as `GetObject` and `PutObject`\. Each access point has distinct permissions and network controls\. 

You can create and manage your S3 on Outposts buckets, access points, and endpoints by using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or REST API\. To upload and manage objects in your S3 on Outposts bucket, you can use the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or REST API\. 

### Regions<a name="aws-region-s3-outposts"></a>

During AWS Outposts provisioning, you or AWS creates a service link connection that connects your Outpost back to your chosen AWS Region or Outposts home Region for bucket operations and telemetry\. An Outpost relies on connectivity to the parent AWS Region\. The Outposts rack is not designed for disconnected operations or environments with limited to no connectivity\. For more information, see [Outpost connectivity to AWS Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/how-outposts-works.html#region-connectivity) in the *AWS Outposts User Guide*\.

### Buckets<a name="BasicsBucketS3Outposts"></a>

A bucket is a container for objects stored in S3 on Outposts\. You can store any number of objects in a bucket and can have up to 100 buckets per account per Outpost\. 

When you create a bucket, you enter a bucket name and choose the Outpost where the bucket will reside\. After you create a bucket, you cannot change the bucket name or move the bucket to a different Outpost\. Bucket names must follow [Amazon S3 bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html)\. In S3 on Outposts, bucket names are unique to an Outpost and AWS account\. S3 on Outposts buckets require the `outpost-id`, `account-id`, and bucket name to identify them\. The following example shows the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) format for S3 on Outposts buckets\. The ARN is comprised of the Region your Outpost is homed to, your Outpost account, the Outpost ID, and the bucket name\.

```
arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:account-id:outpost/outpost-id/bucket/bucket-name
```

Every object is contained in a bucket\. You must use access points to access any object in an Outposts bucket\. When you specify the bucket for object operations, you use the access point ARN, which includes the `outpost-id`, `account-id`, and access point name\. The following example shows the ARN format for S3 on Outposts access points in object operations:

```
arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:account-id:outpost/outpost-id/accesspoint/accesspoint-name
```

For more information about buckets, see [Working with S3 on Outposts buckets](S3OutpostsWorkingBuckets.md)\. 

### Objects<a name="BasicsObjectsS3Outposts"></a>

Objects are the fundamental entities stored in S3 on Outposts\. Objects consist of object data and metadata\. The metadata is a set of name\-value pairs that describe the object\. These pairs include some default metadata, such as the date last modified, and standard HTTP metadata, such as `Content-Type`\. You can also specify custom metadata at the time that the object is stored\. An object is uniquely identified within a bucket by a [key \(or name\)](Welcome.md#BasicsKeys)\.

With Amazon S3 on Outposts, object data is always stored on the Outpost\. When AWS installs an Outpost rack, your data stays local to your Outpost to meet data\-residency requirements\. Your objects never leave your Outpost and are not in an AWS Region\. Because the AWS Management Console is hosted in\-Region, you can't use the console to upload or manage objects in your Outpost\. However, you can use the REST API, AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), and AWS SDKs to upload and manage your objects through your access points\.

### Keys<a name="BasicsKeysS3Outposts"></a>

An *object key* \(or *key name*\) is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket\. Every object in a bucket has exactly one key\. The combination of a bucket and object key uniquely identifies each object\. 

The following example shows the ARN format for S3 on Outposts objects, which includes the AWS Region code for the Region that the Outpost is homed to, AWS account ID, Outpost ID, bucket name, and object key:

```
arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:â€‹outpost/op-01ac5d28a6a232904/bucket/DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1/object/myobject
```

For more information about object keys, see [Working with S3 on Outposts objects](S3OutpostsWorkingObjects.md)\. 

### S3 Versioning<a name="S3OutpostsVersioning"></a>

You can use S3 Versioning on Outposts buckets to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket\. With S3 Versioning, you can preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your buckets\. S3 Versioning helps you recover from unintended user actions and application failures\. 

For more information, see [Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket](S3OutpostsManagingVersioning.md)\.

### Version ID<a name="S3OutpostsVersionID"></a>

When you enable S3 Versioning in a bucket, S3 on Outposts generates a unique version ID for each object added to the bucket\. Objects that already existed in the bucket at the time that you enable versioning have a version ID of `null`\. If you modify these \(or any other\) objects with other operations, such as [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html), the new objects get a unique version ID\.

For more information, see [Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket](S3OutpostsManagingVersioning.md)\.

### Storage class and encryption<a name="S3OutpostsStorageClasses"></a>

S3 on Outposts provides a new storage class, S3 Outposts \(`OUTPOSTS`\)\. The S3 Outposts storage class is available only for objects stored in buckets on AWS Outposts\. If you try to use other S3 storage classes with S3 on Outposts, S3 on Outposts returns the `InvalidStorageClass` error\. 

By default, objects stored in the S3 Outposts \(`OUTPOSTS`\) storage class are encrypted using server\-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys \(SSE\-S3\)\. For more information, see [Data encryption in S3 on Outposts](s3-outposts-data-encryption.md)\. 

### Bucket policy<a name="S3OutpostsBucketPolicies"></a>

A bucket policy is a resource\-based AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policy that you can use to grant access permissions to your bucket and the objects in it\. Only the bucket owner can associate a policy with a bucket\. The permissions attached to the bucket apply to all of the objects in the bucket that are owned by the bucket owner\. Bucket policies are limited to 20 KB in size\.

Bucket policies use JSON\-based IAM policy language that is standard across AWS\. You can use bucket policies to add or deny permissions for the objects in a bucket\. Bucket policies allow or deny requests based on the elements in the policy\. These elements can include the requester, S3 on Outposts actions, resources, and aspects or conditions of the request \(for example, the IP address used to make the request\)\. For example, you can create a bucket policy that grants cross\-account permissions to upload objects to an S3 on Outposts bucket while ensuring that the bucket owner has full control of the uploaded objects\. For more information, see [Bucket policy examples](example-bucket-policies.md)\.

In your bucket policy, you can use wildcard characters \(`*`\) in ARNs and other values to grant permissions to a subset of objects\. For example, you can control access to groups of objects that begin with a common [prefix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#keyprefix) or end with a given extension, such as `.html`\.

### S3 on Outposts access points<a name="BasicsAccessPointsS3Outposts"></a>

S3 on Outposts access points are named network endpoints with dedicated access policies that describe how data can be accessed using that endpoint\. Access points simplify managing data access at scale for shared datasets in S3 on Outposts\. Access points are attached to buckets that you can use to perform S3 object operations, such as `GetObject` and `PutObject`\.

Access points have distinct permissions and network controls that S3 on Outposts applies for any request that is made through that access point\. Each access point enforces a customized access point policy that works in conjunction with the bucket policy that is attached to the underlying bucket\.

For more information, see [Accessing your S3 on Outposts buckets and objects](S3OutpostsNetworking.md#AccessingS3Outposts)\.
