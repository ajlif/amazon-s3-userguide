# Retrieving object versions from a versioning\-enabled bucket<a name="RetrievingObjectVersions"></a>

Versioning in Amazon S3 is a way of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket\. A simple `GET` request retrieves the current version of an object\. The following figure shows how `GET` returns the current version of the object, `photo.gif`\.

To retrieve a specific version, you have to specify its version ID\. The following figure shows that a `GET versionId` request retrieves the specified version of the object \(not necessarily the current one\)\.

You can retrieve object versions in Amazon S3 using the console, AWS SDKs, or REST API\.

**Note**  
 To access object versions older than 300 versions, you must use the AWS CLI or the object's URL\.

## Using the S3 console<a name="retrieving-object-versions"></a>

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the **Buckets** list, choose the name of the bucket that contains the object\.

1. In the **Objects** list, choose the name of the object\.

1. Choose **Versions**\.

   Amazon S3 shows all the versions for the object\.

1. Select the check box next to the **Version ID** for the versions that you want to retrieve\.

1. Choose **Actions**, choose **Download**, and save the object\.

You also can view, download, and delete object versions in the object overview panel\. For more information, see [Viewing an object overview in the Amazon S3 console](view-object-overview.md)\.

**Important**  
You can undelete an object only if it was deleted as the latest \(current\) version\. You can't undelete a previous version of an object that was deleted\. For more information, see [Using versioning in S3 buckets](Versioning.md)\.

## Using the AWS SDKs<a name="retrieve-obj-version-sdks"></a>

The examples for uploading objects in nonversioned and versioning\-enabled buckets are the same\. However, for versioning\-enabled buckets, Amazon S3 assigns a version number\. Otherwise, the version number is null\.

For examples of downloading objects using AWS SDKs for Java, \.NET, and PHP, see [Downloading objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/download-objects.html)\.

## Using the REST API<a name="retrieve-obj-version-rest"></a>

**To retrieve a specific object version**

1. Set `versionId` to the ID of the version of the object that you want to retrieve\.

1. Send a `GET Object versionId` request\.

**Example â€” Retrieving a versioned object**  
The following request retrieves version `L4kqtJlcpXroDTDmpUMLUo` of `my-image.jpg`\.  

```
1. GET /my-image.jpg?versionId=L4kqtJlcpXroDTDmpUMLUo HTTP/1.1
2. Host: bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
3. Date: Wed, 28 Oct 2009 22:32:00 GMT
4. Authorization: AWS AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE:0RQf4/cRonhpaBX5sCYVf1bNRuU=
```

You can retrieve just the metadata of an object \(not the content\)\. For information, see [Retrieving the metadata of an object version](RetMetaOfObjVersion.md)\.

For information about restoring a previous object version, see [Restoring previous versions](RestoringPreviousVersions.md)\.
